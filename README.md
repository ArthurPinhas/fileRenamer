# fileRenamer

A simple C# file renaming tool based on file metadata.

This program renames files within a specified folder based on their creation date or last modified date. If a file with the same name already exists, it creates copies with unique names.

Features
- Renames files based on creation date or last modified date.
- Handles conflicts by creating copies with unique names.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the program using a C# compiler (e.g., `dotnet build`).
3. Run the program with a folder path as an argument to rename files within that folder.

Example:

`dotnet run /path/to/your/folder`
